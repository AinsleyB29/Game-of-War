Have you played the card game [War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX-jOVer758)? Which is also colloquially referred to as "1-2-3-4-I-DECLARE-WAR"

# How it works

Two players evenly split a shuffled deck of 52 standard playing cards. Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their stack or rearrange them. The objective of the game is to play until one player has all 52 cards in their stack.

Players take turns playing the top card from their stacks. Whoever's card is a higher value puts both cards at the bottom of their stack.

If there is a tie, then it's War! Each player adds three cards of their stack face down. Each player reveals their fourth card. Whoever wins that reveal takes all of the cards! If there is another tie the process repeats until there is a winner.

# Description

I built this simple card game project using vanilla JS. There is no user interaction so the computer plays itself until there is a winner.
